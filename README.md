# Digital-Clock-using-Python
This is going to be a well documented project on making of DIGITAL CLOCK using Tkinter and Datetime module.

# Steps
1. Design the interface using Tkinter
2. Adjust the real time using Datetime

# Problems faced on the way and their solution

# Suggestions 

#### JUST A THOUGHT

When we were making the labels, we faced a problem of repeatedly copy and pasting the same code again and again and then only tweaking the coordinates and dimensions.
If we create a function with the things to be varied as its parameter and encode the rest of the thing which stays the same in the body of the function, it could resolve the problem of copy pasting the same bit of code.

It is a solution using the** Modularity.**

** Approach 2**
We can create a class like Tk(), in which methods like position(), dimension() will be present similar to configure(), geometry(). 
Then we can create the labels as objects of the class and then initialize different parameters of the object using the methods contained in the class.
